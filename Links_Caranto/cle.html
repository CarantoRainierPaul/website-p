                    <blockquote>  <sup>1</sup>Summer after I graduated from high school, I had this thought that came into my mind.<sup>2</sup>
                        What if I try again and be an athlete again? I would get to study in big schools and I won’t have to worry about the funds that I would need for me to study in such.<sup>3</sup> And then I started to search for schools that are open for tryouts.<sup>4</sup> Then one day, my coach from UE messaged me that they will have a tryout and I said that I’m going to be there, then suddenly I realized that on the day of tryouts, I also have a research defense on the same day.<sup>5</sup> I honestly didn’t know what to do, I didn’t know if I would still make it to the tryouts.<sup>6</sup> Fast forward to that day, The defense was successful but I’m still having a hard time if I’d still go to the tryouts because I might be late for it and then someone pushed me and told me that I should go after it.<sup>7</sup> I packed my clothes and shoes and then got to the tryouts.<sup>8</sup> When I got there, my coach gave me a condition that If I would be able to do what I did when I won the silver medal in my high school year, he would give me a scholarship for college, and in God’s grace I did it! I really believe that it was all God’s plan.<sup>9</sup> I am thankful for all the things that he has done for me and all of the things that I’ve experienced growing up.<sup>10</sup> While I'm writing this down, right now I'm a 2nd year Bachelor of Science in Information Technology.<sup>11</sup> If you would ask me why, well because I was curious.<sup>12</sup> I was curious on how these websites work, how  these games work, basically everything that runs in a computer.<sup>13</sup> I wanted to know how they run through a computer.<sup>14</sup> I want to know how they became everything possible inside a computer.<sup>15</sup> Right now I was amazed that I'm learning all about it and I can say that I'm really interested about all of it.<sup>16</sup> It's not that easy but if I really keep working hard, I'll be where I want myself to be.<sup>17</sup> Every dream was just a thought on your mind at first, until you want it and work hard for it.<sup>18</sup> And every single dream is still here in me and I know that it was planted here in my head for a reason.<sup>19</sup> I’ll make sure that every sacrifices and challenges I overcome won't be put to waste.<sup>20</sup> I know that I just have to keep going and that’s what I’m going to do.<sup>21</sup>I'm Rainier Paul Caranto, and I am a Dreamer.<sup>22</sup>
