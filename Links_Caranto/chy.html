                <blockquote> <sup>1</sup>My childhood is just that simple, but full of memories.<sup>2</sup> Memorable events in my life and of course memorable people.<sup>3</sup> I was born in Micronesia, USA and then my grandmother took me home to the Philippines when I was two(2) months old.<sup>4</sup> I grew up here in Malabon City with my grandparents together with my mother’s siblings.<sup>5</sup>
                    Even if I was away from my real family, I was still thankful for my grandparents because of how well they took care of me.<sup>6</sup> If I'm going to be honest, when I was a kid I was jealous of how my family lived, because I was here in the Philippines and they’re still in Micronesia, USA living happily together.<sup>7</sup> But I came to realize that me being here with my grandparents and my uncles and aunties helped me to become what I am now.<sup>8</sup> I always think that it would’ve been different if my grandmother did not take me from the US.<sup>9</sup> My childhood was really memorable, just like other people’s experiences.<sup>10</sup> Playing in the streets, getting beaten by a hanger or a belt by your elders, getting scolded by your elders, and more.<sup>11</sup> Like I said, just like other people’s childhood experiences.<sup>12</sup> And when I said memorable people, my uncle who’s been like a brother to me won’t miss the top list, because growing up we’re always together.<sup>13</sup> I think he is also the one who shaped my character when I was a kid until now.<sup>14</sup> We have many similar characteristics.<sup>15</sup> When you say memories, we all think about the best or the worst experiences we ever had.<sup>16</sup> One memory I recall was how influential wrestling became for me.<sup>17</sup> I was literally crazy about them.<sup>18</sup> Watching them all the time, copying what they do, my cousins and I even wrestle in our room most of the time.<sup>19</sup> That’s how influential wrestling is for us.<sup>20</sup> I think that was one of the most memorable things I’ve done of course based on my life right now, seeing them again on our screens and get to recall every single thing you have done because of them, it always feels nostalgic.<sup>21</sup> If we’re going to talk about academics, I think I excelled from my 1st grade until my 3rd grade.<sup>22</sup> If you would ask why, well because I focused too much on extra curricular activities and of course my silliness.<sup>23</sup> I didn’t do well in school but I made sure that I would still have the most fun.<sup>24</sup> I became a lyrist at my school’s drum and lyre band, became a member of the student council, a volunteer at Save the Children, a volunteer at the Red cross, and this is where I started my career as a Student-Athlete.<sup>25</sup> Won Regional competition and I also won the Palarong Pambansa which is one of the biggest competitions here in the Philippines.<sup>26</sup> Winning gave me a lot of opportunities and opened the door that will give me a chance to study at big schools such as University of the East.<sup>27</sup>
