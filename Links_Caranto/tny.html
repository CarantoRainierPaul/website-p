                    <blockquote> <sup>1</sup>Winning gave me a lot of opportunities and opened the door that will give me a chance to study at big schools such as University of the East.<sup>2</sup> Starting my high school life isn’t easy, It opened my eyes to some things that I never got to experience before.<sup>3</sup> I remember that before I became an athlete, I only wanted to study at public schools that were near our house at that time, but then because of how hard I worked as an athlete and how my coach trained me, everything became possible.<sup>4</sup> Though I became too focused on me being an athlete and forgot that I was also a student.<sup>5</sup> Also due to influences and my silliness, I started to fail at school.<sup>6</sup> It was really a hard time for me during those days because to compete, I had to pass my grades in school and I failed to do it.<sup>7</sup> Before the school started I told my coach that I was going to be back in Palarong Pambansa and win again though representing a different school and in a higher division.<sup>8</sup> I thought of everything I did wrong and I was really down thinking about everything that I would’ve done if I only did everything right.<sup>9</sup> But as they say, turn losses into lessons.<sup>10</sup> After that day, I started to make it up for myself and get ready for the upcoming competitions, and I think because of that loss I took where I failed my grades and also failed to compete, it made me better and actually came 2nd on the UAAP the following sem and on my rookie year! It was really a big achievement for me and I realized that doing this sport is what I love.<sup>11</sup> I just have to do what is right and everything will follow.<sup>12</sup> But after everything went down, This is where the virus and pandemic started.<sup>13</sup> Right after the dreams begin to be clear, there goes the challenges that will strike you in the face.<sup>14</sup> I didn’t know what to do during those days.<sup>15</sup> I can only open my laptop and my phone, that is where our life circled basically.<sup>16</sup> Because of the challenges I faced and hard times I experienced, I got kicked out of the team.<sup>17</sup> It took out my scholarship.<sup>18</sup> I didn’t know what to do and I cried when my coach said it directly to me.<sup>19</sup> I told my parents that I won’t have my scholarship for my last year of high school and that I’ll need money to finish my school.<sup>20</sup> Thankfully, my parents still gave me a chance to study in University of the East and graduate high school.<sup>21</sup>
